What you see here is the geographical spread of recent world news, as reported by the New York Times.

#####Some cool features

+ Drag your mouse/finger across the chart in the 'Time' section to see articles in a particular date range
+ Click on the name of a place in in 'Place' section to filter by that location
+ Drill down by clicking on the circular article clusters
+ Shift+click+drag to zoom in on a rectangular area of the map
+ Click on an individual map marker to get info on and a link to an article

#####What's underneath
This thing works by periodically grabbing articles in the New York Times World section, using the [New York Times Article Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/article_search_api) and finding geodata for article locations with [Open Street Map's Nominatim](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim). The 500 most recent articles are shown. A small number of articles may be missing: those for which no locations are provided, or for which no lat/lon pairs are found, are thrown out.

The map itself is produced by [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and some of its great [plugins](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html), with map tiles served by [MapBox](http://www.mapbox.com/). Lots of other functionality depends on [d3js](http://d3js.org/), and the filtering is powered by [crossfilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/).
